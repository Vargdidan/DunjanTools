#### Verified working with Godot C# v3.2.2

## DunjanTools
A minimalistic Virtual Tabletop.

### Problems running?
Sometimes I have had an issue with opening the project when I swapped computers. Might be that I have dragged with me some local-settings into the repository. It worked once I went into the project.godot file, and removed "run/main_scene="res://GUI/MainMenu.tscn"" under [Application]. Then it usually opens up and you can re-set the main_scene.
