# DunjanTools
A minimalistic Virtual Tabletop.

# Goal
Have a embedded, easy to use VTT, that is not bogged down with overwhelmingy many features.

DunjanTools were ment as a supplement to dice-rollers, discord/chat programs and different ruleset encylopedias. However, if we find a good way to add these features without making a massive and complicated GUI, go for it! It may be feature rich in the future, but new features should not come in the way for new users to simply join a game, drop tokens and navigate the battlemap.
